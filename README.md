## Description

Greenlight is a web app that serves as a hobby project in which I practice implementing technologies to sharpen my skills. I have the project open source so as to allow other developers and recruiters (or anyone else really) to view my work.

Currently, it allows users to register movies by filling up a form with their title, year of release, runttime and genres.

The current iteration of Greenlight implements a RESTful API in Go for the backend and a vanilla implementation of React for the frontend.

#### Frontend
